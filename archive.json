Or is it on carrier level (each single carrier on a link, whatever the mode of the radio link?\r\n\r\nDue to the frequent change of throughput then also the Bandwidth utilization could change frequently.\r\nIt is mainly a performance counter (both as statistic/timely data value or on period-time basis data value).\r\n\r\nCould it be recovered from the node? It is not a standard counter, so not all devices are able to provide it.\r\nOr based on other data from the node (tx bytes sent) ? In this case it is needed a reference time to calculated delta-time and delta-tx-bytes-sent).\r\n\r\n",
