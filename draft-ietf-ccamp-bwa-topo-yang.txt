1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model to describe bandwidth
   availability for a link.  It is an important characteristic of links
   with variable bandwidth, where each level of bandwidth can be
   associated with a certain level of availability.  An example of such
   a link is microwave radio link, where the bandwidth can be
   dynamically adapted to changing signal conditions, impacted by
   interference & fading, in order to guarantee the required quality of
   the link at every single moment.  [RFC8330] defines a mechanism to
   report bandwidth-availability information through OSPF-TE, but it
   could also be useful for a controller to access such bandwidth-
   availability information as part of the topology model when
   performing a path/route computation.  The model augments "YANG Data
   Model for Traffic Engineering (TE) Topologies" defined in [RFC8795],
   which is based on "A YANG Data Model for Network Topologies" defined
   in [RFC8345].

   The bandwidth availability model is expected to be used between a
   Provisioning Network Controller (PNC) and a Multi Domain Service
   Coordinator(MDSC) [RFC8453].  Examples of use cases that can be
   supported are:

   1.  Propagation of relevant characteristics of a link, including
       bandwidth availability, to higher topology layers, where it e.g.
       could be used as a criterion when configuring and optimizing a
       path for a connection/service through the network end to end.

   2.  A link could dynamically adjust its bandwidth according to
       changes in the signal conditions.  [RFC8330] defines a mechanism
       to report bandwidth-availability information through OSPF-TE, but
       it could also be useful for a controller to access such
       bandwidth-availability information as part of the topology model
       when performing a path/route computation.

4.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines schemas for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   The YANG module specified in this document imports and augments the
   ietf-network and ietf-network-topology models defined in [RFC8345].
   The security considerations from [RFC8345] are applicable to the
   module in this document.

   There are a several data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the data nodes and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   In the "ietf-bandwidth-availability-topology" module:

   *  availability: A malicious client could attempt to modify the
      availability level which could modify the intended behavior.

   *  link-bandwidth: A malicious client could attempt to modify the
      link bandwidth which could either provide more or less link
      bandwidth at the indicated availability level, changing the
      resource allocation in unintended ways.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to assign a new URI from the "IETF XML Registry"
   [RFC3688] as follows:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-bandwidth-availability-topology
   Registrant Contact: The IESG
   XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   It is proposed that IANA should record YANG module names in the "YANG
   Module Names" registry [RFC6020] as follows:

       Name: ietf-bandwidth-availability-topology
       Maintained by IANA?: N
       Namespace:
       urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-bandwidth-availability-topology
       Prefix: bwavtopo
       Reference: RFC XXXX
